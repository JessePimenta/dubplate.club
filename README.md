## Why build dublate.club?

As a vinyl enthusiast, I’ve noticed that 10–15% of my Instagram feed is filled with vinyl center label videos. Over the years, friends have frequently asked me to help them create these "rotating center label" videos or show them how it’s done.

As an artist and label owner myself, I’m no stranger to the tedious process of editing videos with audio and artwork. I’ve spent countless hours in Adobe Premiere animating center labels and adding audio tracks. If you’ve tried this yourself, you know the pain.

That’s why I built this tool — to make it easy for anyone to create rotating center label videos without the hassle.

- add an audio track
- upload your artwork
- customize the background
- export video
- Perfect for showcasing a clip from a vinyl release
- streamlines the entire process into a few steps
