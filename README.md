# Why?

As a label owner and someone who uploads music to youtube, i constantly have to edit videos with audio and artwork and I have grown tired of using Adobe Premiere to animate the center label and add an audio track. I streamlined the entire process into a simple interface and minimal steps.

Now you can easily (and lazily) create rotating center label videos to promote your EP or album. Upload your artwork, add audio, customize the visuals, and export videos in just a few clicks. Perfect for sharing on social media or showcasing your latest release.
